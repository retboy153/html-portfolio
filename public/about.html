<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I am Varun Gupta, a budding web developer eager to dive into the world of coding and design. Recently, I’ve embarked on a journey to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m excited about the endless possibilities that web development offers. My goal is to build beautiful, functional websites and continuously improve my skills.</p>

<p>Though I’m at the beginning of my career, I’m driven by a genuine passion for technology and a curiosity to learn. I’m actively working on personal projects and exploring the latest trends to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field. Each day brings new challenges and opportunities, and I’m ready to tackle them head-on.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I enjoy experimenting with design concepts and keeping up with the latest industry news. I’m always open to connecting with fellow developers and industry professionals to share knowledge and grow together. Let’s create something great!</p>
